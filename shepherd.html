      <p class="synopsis">
       The following information was taken from Wikipedia:<br>
       "<strong>The Shepherd of Hermas</strong> sometimes just called <strong>The Shepherd</strong>, is a Christian literary work of the late first half 
       of the second century, considered a valuable book by many Christians, and considered canonical 
       scripture by some of the early Church fathers such as Irenaeus.[1] The Shepherd was very 
       popular amongst Christians in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th centuries."

    <p>113. I answered, sir, I saw it. Thus,   said he, no man shall enter into the kingdom of God, but he who shall 
    take upon him the <strong>name of the Son of God.</strong>
  </p>
    <p>115. I answered, Sir, how could I do otherwise? As therefore, said he, 
    there would be no other way of entering into that city but by its gate, 
    so neither can any one enter into the kingdom of God, but only by the 
    <strong>name of his Son</strong>, who is most dear 
    unto him. 
  </p>
    <p>117. With those is the Lord encompassed as with a wall: but the gate is the <strong>Son of God</strong>,

<h3>Questions come to mind about the purpose, contents and style of the book</h3>
<hr>
<p class="synopsis">
If the author was concerned with presenting information essential to the salvation of one's eternal soul,
why is the redemptive work of Jesus allegorized throughout the entire book? Why not simply present the facts about Jesus'
message and ministry and let the Holy Spirit do the work of calling the believer?  It seems the purpose of the text
is long-form persuation and indoctrination, not salvation by believing in the redemptive work of Jesus in history.
</p>
<p class="synopsis">
  Why is <strong>the Son</strong> not named? Why is the name "Jesus" absent from the entire text?
  There is an emphasis on knowing <strong>the name of the Son of God</strong>, as if his name is a mystery
  which, once revealed to the initiate, the power of the name itself brings the initiate into the secret family of God.
  I imagine early Christianity (associated with the sect that circulated this text) to be a mystery religion where 
  the proselyte is initated by baptism and then told the secret, powerful name of the Son of God. They must then continue
  in the faith by attending communion (a common practice of mystery cults in those days) and bringing regular tithes
  to maintain their position in God's Holy Church.
</p>
<p class="synopsis">
    The New Testament canon and the essential teachings of Christianity come down to us through history from
    the early Orthodox/Catholic church. The Shepherd of Hermas was once early considered "canon" by the Church.
    This early text is clearly story-telling and myth-making. If that's the case with The Shepherd, it's also
    true of the rest of the New Testament.
